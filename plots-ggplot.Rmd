# Plots with `ggplot2`

We are going to make plots in R and it's going to be amazing.

```{r load_packages}

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)

```

```{r load_ca_np}

ca_np <- read_csv(here("data", "ca_np.csv"))
```

```{r load_ci_np}

ci_np <- read_excel(here("data", "ci_np.xlsx"))
```

```{r plot_ci_np}

ggbase <- ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors))

ggbase +
  geom_point(color = "purple",
             pch = 17,
             size = 4,
             alpha = 0.5
             )

# ggbase +
#  geom_point()

```

```{r}
gg_np <- ggplot(data = ca_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors, group = park_name))
```
